# machine-learning
Projects are done as a part of Big Data Analytics studies:
- HumanActivityRecognition is a project of the system for the classification of 6 activities like standing, sitting, etc. using LSTM on raw data (signals) and CNN on data transformed to images using Continuous Wavelet Transform
- InflationRate is a project for forecasting inflation using Exponential Smoothing, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, DecisionTree, XGB Regressor, and Ada Boost
- fake_news_ml_xai studies only titles of fake news, the classification model is built using several classic ML methods (SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Boosting), 1D CNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, GRU and DistilBERT from HuggingFace additionally XAI methods like LIME and SHAP are applied and perform adversarial attacks based on previous analyses using SHAP
